Welcome!

This is a program written entirely in c++ that gives the product and sum of anywhere between 2 and 11 polynomials. Polynomial is the class used to store a linked list to represent the polynomial itself(each struct/node is a term in polynomial).

To end the program, input zero when asked for amount of polynomials desired.

Limitions: cannot multiply polynomials with a variable by zero(will crash program).
